# Economic-dynamic-model
In this project i have utilized the non linear dynamics of mathematical nature to map out economical expenditure of a group/orhanisation treated as a normalized population. The expenditure and market are of essential Nonlinear aspect hence the relevance of enhanced computing is required to optimize time. Utilizing non-linear mathematical dynamics, I analyzed the economic expenditure of an organization as a normalized population. The inherently non-linear nature of both the expenditure and the market made it necessary to leverage advanced computing techniques to optimize time and improve the accuracy of our predictions.
